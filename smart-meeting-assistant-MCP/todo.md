  - [x] ~~`create_meeting` - Creates meetings with database integration~~
  - [x] ~~`health_check` - Server status with database connection~~
  - [x] ~~`get_server_info` - Server capabilities and planned tools~~
- [x] ~~Test FastMCP server starts correctly~~
- [x] ~~Fix Claude Desktop integration (absolute path solution)~~
- [x] ~~Test all tools work with Claude Desktop~~
- [x] ~~Clean up test files and scripts~~
